Over the years I've worked on various data loaders or web scrapers,
integrating following sources (among other):

- Public registers from Slovak, French and UK gov (scrapy)
- Public images from NASA, European Space Agency, and Solar Dynamics Observatory (scrapy)
- Public event listings from various Biotech websites (scrapy)
- Reddit (praw)
- SoundClound (custom JavaScript)
- CrunchBase (custom JavaScript)
- Slant.co (custom JavaScript)
